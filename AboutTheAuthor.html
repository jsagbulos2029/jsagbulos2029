        <p class="m">M</p>
        <p class="n">y name is Johanna Nicole Agbulos,</p>
        <p class="p">and I am currently a student of 9-Balingkilat.</p>
        <div class="container">
        <p>I am 15 years old, and I have been a big fan of fictional stories since I was really young.</p>
        <p>Movies were my introduction into really enjoying a narrative and forming a connection with a character.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="o">It was from the How to train your dragon franchise that made me love dragons and the idea of mythological creatures. Then I got into books where my interests began to deepen. In particular, I really grew to love Greek mythology ever since I read Percy Jackson.</p>
        <p class="q">I am also a fan of other genres such as sci-fi, dystopian, mystery, and thriller.</p>
        <p class="r">Hobbies I have include reading, writing, drawing, and occasionally even gaming.</p>
        <p class="l">My all time favorite series is Percy Jackson. I first got into Rick Riordan's writing when I watched the movie Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief, and then I fell deep into the rabbit hole, haha! My favorite of the books that I have read from the series would be The Last Olympian. During the costume day of 2024 I even dressed up as a camper of Camp Half-Blood!</p>

        <p class="h">I'm also fond of dragons! My favorite book series about these creatures is called Wings of Fire written by Tui T. Sutherland. I love it so much that I have even drawn characters from the books and even drawn characters that I have created out of my own imagination based on the series. The picture shows a digital drawing of one of the characters I created. I drew it on Ibispaint X, which I use often for drawing as I don't usually bring a sketchpad with me.</p>
